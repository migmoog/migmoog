Hello there! I'm Jeremy (a.k.a. migmoog)

I make games in the godot engine (usually with my friends in [Team Max Hog](https://twitter.com/TeamMaxHog)) and enjoy writing C++ and Rust. Most of my games are on my [newgrounds](https://migmoog.newgrounds.com), and any other programming projects I have end up here.

I also occaisionally write blogs and tutorials, mainly on Godot usage.

Thank you for reading and enjoy your perusings of my work!

אוה, וגם אני מדבר עברית
